	<CD.M.tutorial.item.count>Using new item count field</CD.M.tutorial.item.count>
	<CD.M.tutorial.item.count.description>You'll notice that there's a new checkbox on "Do until you have X" bills called "Custom item count".
Turning this on, you can customize what the recipe counts to check how much of something it has.
For example, if you type in "category meals", it will count "simple meal", "fine meal", "packaged survival meal", etc.

Leaving "Custom item count" off will use the default counting logic.</CD.M.tutorial.item.count.description>

	<CD.M.tutorial.searching.things>Searching Things</CD.M.tutorial.searching.things>
	<CD.M.tutorial.searching.things.description>You can search any Thing in the game such as "slate blocks", ostriches, "compacted steel", etc.
The count you get back will not include forbidden items, and will take into account the recipe's settings. E.G. if an item has 40% hitpoints but recipe requires 50%, it won't be counted.

To search a ThingDef you need to convert the in-game name, make it lowercase, and wrap it in speech marks.
Item quality, material and stack count should also be omitted from the name.
If it has speech marks or full stops in its name, replace them with an underscore: _
Singular words like ostrich don't always need speechmarks - it's up to you.

Let's look at some examples:
Compacted steel -> "compacted steel"
Medicine x5 -> "medicine"
Go-juice -> "go-juice"
Uranium mace (legendary) -> mace</CD.M.tutorial.searching.things.description>

	<CD.M.tutorial.searching.stats>Searching Thing Stats</CD.M.tutorial.searching.stats>
	<CD.M.tutorial.searching.stats.description>Things have stats like "market value", "nutrition", "mech bandwidth". This mod supports two types of stat searching.

The first type lets you search the stat of a Thing's prefab. This value is always the same, it doesn't depend on how many of that item you have or the quality of those items - It's the value those items normally have.

The second type lets you search the stats of individual items you own. This search is performed by putting "owned", "own" or "o" before the name of the StatDef.

Some examples of both:
"kibble.nutrition" will give you 0.05, the nutritional value of one piece of kibble.
"kibble.owned nutrition" will give you the total nutrition you have in stored kibble.

This also works on categories, and will add up the result from every item in that category.
"category meals.o nutrition" will return how much nutrition you have in stored meals.
"category meals.nutrition" is pretty useless, but shows it's possible.</CD.M.tutorial.searching.stats.description>

	<CD.M.tutorial.searching.categories>Searching categories</CD.M.tutorial.searching.categories>
	<CD.M.tutorial.searching.categories.description>You can search any category of things in game, such as "category raw food", "cat textiles", "c meals", etc. Categories can be seen in any stockpile or bill menu.

Categories are written just like Things, except you start the variable with the word "category"", or "cat", or simply "c".
Here are some examples:
Humanlike corpses -> "category humanlike corpses"
Meals -> "c meals"
Eggs (unfert.) -> "cat eggs (unfert_)"</CD.M.tutorial.searching.categories.description>

	<CD.M.tutorial.searching.traits>Searching traits</CD.M.tutorial.searching.traits>
	<CD.M.tutorial.searching.traits.description>You can search any trait on any pawn group, such as "pawns.traits.jogger", "colonists.traits.nudist", "colonists.traits.gay"</CD.M.tutorial.searching.traits.description>

	<CD.M.tutorial.example.intake.description>Calculates how much nutrition your pawns need for 5 days.
A meal provides 0.9 nutrition, so this roughly gives you how many simple meals you'll need to cook to have 5 days of food.</CD.M.tutorial.example.intake.description>
